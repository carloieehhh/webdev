            <h2>Our Heritage <br><br></h2>
            <h3>A brand that started off in Bagpi in Taytay Rizal in 2017,
            Is a cafe franchise that now has more than a dozen branches located in the region. <br>
            This one in Los Banos began as a humble kart in 2018, and in February 2022, its owners Juanay and Mikki were finally able to open their own shop.<br><br>
            Drip Kofi is a local cafe that's passionate about serving authenthic Vietnamese coffee.
            Within its cozy and contemporary interiors with white walls, wooden furniture,
            and potted plants and dried flowers, you are served their special caffeinated beverages like
            the Ca Phe Sua Da (Vietnamese iced coffee). It has just the right sweetness to it and
            at the same time gives you a good caffeine kick.<br><br></h3>

            <h2>Coffee & Craft <br><br></h2>
            <h3>Prices at Drip range from P100 to about P180, so it's affordable. There's a variety of flavors 
            to choose from, and you can customize them further with add-ons. It's hard to go wrong with Drip's
            menu because all the caffeinated beverages use the same base Vietnamese coffee. Drip has a 
            selection of pastries including croissants, cookies, and macarons, as well as pasta from local suppliers.<br><br>
            Drip Kofi is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, allowing it to brew. There are several methods
            for doing this, including using a filter. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method
            used, such as drip-brewed coffee, or, somewhat inaccurately, filtered coffee in general.<br><br>
            Our very first cafe and the main branch is in Taytay, Rizal. You can come and drop by at
            149 E. Rodriguez Ave. Brgy. San Isidro Taytay Rizal (landmark: Siena College Taytay). We have
            several branches in Rizal. We are also present in Antipolo, Binangonan, Cainta, and Laguna, too!<br><br><br></h3>

            <h2>Our Partners <br><br></h2>
            <h3>We like to say that we are not in the coffee business serving people, but in the people business
            serving coffee. Our employees - who we call partners - are the heart of the Drip Kofi experience. We are committed
            to making our partners proud and investing in their health, well-being and success and to creating
            a culture of belonging where everyone is welcome. <br><br>
            Our aspiration is to be people positive - investing in humanity and the well-being of everyone we connect
            with, from our partners to coffee farmers to the customers in our stores and beyond.</h3>
